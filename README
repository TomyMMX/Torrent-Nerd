Torrent Nerd 
Middleware for media torrent downloading.
Oppening a torrent with Torrent Nerd (if it is a torrent of a movie or series) shows the
basic imdb data for the content and available subtitles on a well known subtitle site. <- this part works

The first release will also include interoperability with transmission and uTorrent, so the downloaded files get unpacked
(if rar-ed) and the .avi and subtitle files get copied together so everithing can be played with no hassle for the user.
