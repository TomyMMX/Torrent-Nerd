Torrent Nerd 
Middleware for media torrent downloading.
Oppening a torrent with Torrent Nerd (if it is a torrent of a movie or series) shows the
basic data (and rating) for the content and available subtitles on a well known subtitle site. <- this part works

The first release will also include interoperability with transmission and uTorrent, so the downloaded files get unpacked
(if rar-ed) and the .avi and subtitle files get copied together so everithing can be played with no hassle for the user.
If we have multiple media files the app tries to guess the order and generates an appropriate playlist (compatible with VLC... others to come).
